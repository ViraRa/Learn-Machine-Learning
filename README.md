# ML Basics

- Supervised Learning - Given features and labels from a data set classify the features associated with the appropriate outputs. The result is a set of rules that a programmer can use to infer the output given the correct parameters

- Unsupervised Learning - Given features from a data set cluster similiar and different features together. Use the appropriate classifer such as k - nearest neighbor to identify unknown data points. The result is a set of labels for the features that served as inputs

- Train the model then infer from the model
