Learning Tensor Flow 2.0 Basics 

Tensor Flow is a Python module created by Google that can do machine learning, 
artificial intelligence and scientific computing. 

Machine Learning is subset of AI. ML attempts to take the data and its output (Label) 
to figure out a set of rules (a program). The goal is increase accouracy of models.
Below is a general schematic

Data --------->  ____________________
                |                    |
                |     ML Program     |    -----------> Rules  
                |____________________|                   |
OutPut ------->                                          |
                                                         |
                                                         |
                                                         V  
                                                        + Parameters
                                                        w/ traditional programming
                                                        |
                                                        |
                                                        |
                                                        V
                                                        Result


Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning and uses networking 
(a multi - layered process) as a another way to represent data
