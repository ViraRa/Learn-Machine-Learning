Learning Tensor Flow 2.0 Basics 

Tensor Flow is a Python module created by Google that can do machine learning, 
artificial intelligence and scientific computing. 

Machine Learning is subset of AI. ML attempts to take the data and its output to 
figure out a set of rules (a program). The goal is increase accouracy of models.
Below is a general schematic
